        /*An object becomes an iterator when it implements the .next() method.
        The .next() method is a zero arguments function that returns an object with two properties:
        
        VALUE : the data representing the next value in the sequence of values within the object
        
        DONE : a boolean representing if the iterator is done going through the sequence of values
        If done is true, then the iterator has reached the end of its sequence of values.
        If done is false, then the iterator is able to produce another value in its sequence of values.
        Here’s the example from earlier, but instead we are using the array’s default iterator to step through the each value in the array.
